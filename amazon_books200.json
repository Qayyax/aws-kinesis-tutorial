Yet, Samantha just can't muster the energy to do so, not after the hellish week she's had. Her whole life has been spent playing by the rules, and for what? An empty apartment, a career with no upward movement, and one failed relationship after another. When it all blows up in her face, what's a girl to do but book a last-minute trip to the ridiculously named Laughing Mermaid Bed & Breakfast on an unknown speck of an island in the Caribbean? Lucas Mosteron knows all about burning out from first-hand experience. Over the years, he's discovered that he isn't the only one, as everyone has their own unique story for landing on Siren Island. His lovely and mysterious neighbors at The Laughing Mermaid Bed & Breakfast are no exception. Little does he know that there is more to their story than he could ever have imagined possible. When Samantha Jameson arrives as their guest - depleted and needing respite, Lucas can't help but feel like he could be the man she needs. Irresistibly drawn to her uptight demeanor, Lucas is determined to unwind Samantha and show her that life on Siren Island could be the answer to all her problems."

Communicating with Data aims to help students and researchers write about their insights in a way that is both compelling and faithful to the data. General advice on science writing is also provided, including how to distill findings into a story and organize and revise the story, and how to write clearly, concisely, and precisely. This is an excellent resource for students who want to learn how to write about scientific findings, and for instructors who are teaching a science course in communication or a course with a writing component. Communicating with Data consists of five parts. Part I helps the novice learn to write by reading the work of others. Part II delves into the specifics of how to describe data at a level appropriate for publication, create informative and effective visualizations, and communicate an analysis pipeline through well-written, reproducible code. Part III demonstrates how to reduce a data analysis to a compelling story and organize and write the first draft of a technical paper. Part IV addresses revision; this includes advice on writing about statistical findings in a clear and accurate way, general writing advice, and strategies for proof reading and revising. Part V offers advice about communication strategies beyond the page, which include giving talks, building a professional network, and participating in online communities. This book also provides 22 portfolio prompts that extend the guidance and examples in the earlier parts of the book and help writers build their portfolio of data communication."

    "Description": "This book is for business executives and students who want to learn about the tools used in machine learning. In creating the third edition, John Hull has continued to improve his material. He has added new case studies and new material on the applications of neural networks. The book explains the most popular algorithms clearly and succinctly without using calculus or matrix/vector algebra. The focus is on business applications. There are many illustrative examples throughout the book. These include assessing the risk of a country for international investment, predicting the value of real estate, classifying retail loans as acceptable or unacceptable, understanding the behavior of interest rates, using neural networks to understand volatility surface movements, and using reinforcement learning for optimal trade execution. Data, worksheets, and Python code for the examples is on the author's website. A complete set of PowerPoint slides that can be used by instructors is also on the website. The opening chapter reviews different types of machine learning models. It explains the role of the training data set, the validation data set, and the test data set. It also explains the issues involved in cleaning data and covers Bayes\u2019 theorem. Chapter 2 is devoted to unsupervised learning. It explains the k-means algorithm and alternative approaches to clustering. It also covers principal components analysis. Chapter 3 explains linear and logistic regression. It covers regularization using Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net. Chapter 4 covers decision trees. It includes a discussion of the naive Bayes classifier, random forests, and other ensemble methods. Chapter 5, explains how the SVM approach can be used for both linear and non-linear classification as well as for the prediction of a continuous variable. Chapter 6 is devoted to neural networks. It includes a discussion of the gradient descent algorithm and stopping rules. Chapter 7 covers autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Chapter 8 explains reinforcement learning using two games as examples. It covers Q-learning and deep Q-learning, and discusses applications. Chapter 9 covers natural language processing. It discusses how the algorithms introduced in the book can be used for sentiment analysis, language translation, and information retrieval. Chapter 10 is concerned with model interpretability. It discusses the importance of making models understandable and the procedures that can be used for both white-box and black-box models. The final chapter focuses on issues for society. The topics covered include data privacy, biases, ethical considerations, legal issues, and adversarial machine learning. At the ends of chapters there are short concept questions to test the readers understanding of the material and longer exercises. Answers are at the end of the book. The book includes a glossary of terms and an index."

Instead of seeing machine learning as a new field, the authors explore the connection between knowledge developed by quantitative finance over the past forty years and techniques generated by the current revolution driven by data sciences and artificial intelligence. The text is structured around three main areas: 'Interactions with investors and asset owners,' which covers robo-advisors and price formation; 'Risk intermediation,' which discusses derivative hedging, portfolio construction, and machine learning for dynamic optimization; and 'Connections with the real economy,' which explores nowcasting, alternative data, and ethics of algorithms. Accessible to a wide audience, this invaluable resource will allow practitioners to include machine learning driven techniques in their day-to-day quantitative practices, while students will build intuition and come to appreciate the technical tools and motivation for the theory."
